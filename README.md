# TaskFlow

TaskFlow is a modern, responsive task management app built with **React** and **TailwindCSS**, featuring drag-and-drop task management, dark/light mode, persistent storage, productivity stats, and a sleek UI optimized for both desktop and mobile. The app is deployed on **Vercel**.

## Features

-   Create, edit, and delete tasks
-   Categorize tasks (`To Do`, `In Progress`, `Done`)
-   Mark tasks as completed
-   Filter tasks by category or priority
-   Drag-and-drop task reordering (`@hello-pangea/dnd`)
-   View productivity stats (completed vs pending tasks) with charts
-   Persistent data using **LocalStorage**
-   Light/Dark mode toggle (dynamic theme with custom colors)
-   Fully responsive layout
-   Smooth hover and drag animations
-   Footer with copyright, developer name, and dynamic year

## Styling & Theme

-   **Light mode:** soft whites with blue accents for buttons
-   **Dark mode:** ChatGPT-inspired palette (`#444654` for backgrounds, `#10a37f` for checkboxes)
-   Buttons, inputs, and hover effects have subtle animations for polish
-   All components, including **task list, filters, charts, header, and footer**, use this color palette

## Tech Stack

-   React 18+ (functional components, hooks)
-   TailwindCSS for utility-first styling
-   LocalStorage for task persistence
-   Recharts for task statistics visualization
-   `@hello-pangea/dnd` for drag-and-drop functionality
-   Vercel for deployment
